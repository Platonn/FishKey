There are 3 virtual flashcard stacks: *not-asked, known, unknown*. User is asked a word from *not-started* stack. Then he presses one of two buttons: 'I know' or 'I don't know' and is asked a next word. After emptying *not-started* stack there starts a next *round* - the *unknown* stack became a *not-asked* one and game ends when the *not-started* and *unknown* stacks are  empty.
